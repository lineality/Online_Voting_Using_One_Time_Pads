## Questions For Clarification
To clarify goals and questions, below are two lists of questions. Below is a list of questions that we ARE attempting to answer with this project, and below is another list of questions that we are NOT attempting to answer or resolve with this project. This clarification should help with focus, so that questions we are NOT asking do not become confused with questions that we ARE asking.

### Questions to answer and focus on include the following: 
1. Is secure over-a-network(online) voting possible? (Here 'secure' is defined as being 'as secure as a non-networked paper-ballot-voting-system.') 
2. Is it possible for a voter to securely receive a ballot from a Vote-Office over-a-network(online)? 
3. Is it possible for a voter to submit a ballot securely over-a-network(online)?
4. Is it possible for a voting-office to securely receive a completed ballot from the voter over-a-network(online)? [Including: verifying what ballot was used, verifying who submitted the ballot, checking for over errors in filling out the ballot]
5. Is there an effective equivalent of 'encryption' to allow non-tampering over-a-network?
6. Is there an effective equivalent of 'encryption' to allow privacy & security over-a-network?
7. Is a voting system practical and realistic to implement?
8. What is the best way, or what are the best ways, of concretely defining "over-a-network(online)"?
9. What specific instances are there of voting within systems and projects that share the same core processes of choice, voting, and decision making, coordination, etc., while covering applications beyond the single instance of, for example, US national presidential elections, and that cover more partially or entirely automated systems?

## Questions that we are NOT attempting to answer and that we are NOT focusing on in this project include the following: 
1. NOT: Can online voting be an absolutely effortless and perfectly ecstatic experience?
2. NOT: Can a person outside of the direct-voting-process be provably safe from any voter intimidation, coercion, brainwashing, threats, harassment, discouragement, etc? 
3. NOT: Can a person make no mistakes while filling out their ballot? (Though some additional safeguards from this have been successfully used in some states.See reference.) 
4. NOT: Can the physical offices of staff be absolutely impenetrable to a physical break-in or loss of records due to causes such as fires. 
5. NOT: Can hecklers and trolls be prevented from criticizing, slandering, and defaming, the election and election process even when or where there is nothing legitimate to criticize?
6. NOT: Can all disinformation campaigns be eliminated/precluded/etc.?

## Peripherally Related Questions:
1. Are there elements of the voting process that affect (encourage or discourage) participation in the voting process (from user interface to requirements for participation to schedules of voting)? An aspect or implication of this may be inadvertent or targeted discrimination against people for whom a given system of voting is more difficult or less likely to be used.

2. Is there a way to define voting as a more general operationally-defined process that leads to more timely and practical deployments of voting tools and features?

# Concept: Universality, Voting-Procedures and Voting-Processes
The view taken here is that 'voting' is a science-like process. Voting is based on procedures, numbers, measurements, feedback, and data. Voting is neither based on nor negated by not-operationally-defined essences, reifications, fears, dramas, feelings, threats, wishes, trust, authorization, belief-ness, faith, tradition, habits, permission, labels, declarations, blustering, doubts, etc. A vote is like a physical piece of machined metal; A vote exists or does not exist with the measurable features that it has, and these measurable features are and must be measurable and confirm-able by anyone who measures it. The behavior and functionality of a vote is equivalent to that vote's repeatedly measurable features. Any group of people who carry out the STEM-math-science-data process of best-practice-voting have performed voting in a way that can be audited, measured, repeated, clearly discussed, debugged, and results published. No group of people can skip or shortcut required STEM-math-science-data processes without having skipped those required STEM-math-science-data processes. As with a surgeon washing their hands before surgery, "trust" is a term better used to mean that you trust the surgeon IS following best practice, though even then it is best to verify without trust that best practice is being followed. Under no circumstances can (so called) 'trust' replace or permit the skipping of best-practice-processes for people or groups, however much disinformation may demand and violently seek to enforce exemptions from best-practice-processes. In other words, if a person or group says "You MUST trust me, so I do NOT need to wash my hands before performing surgery on you, or processing your vote, in a best practice auditable way", you are by definition being subjected to violence, coercion, fraud, disinformation, and classically-defined tyranny.

(General best practice, systems engineering?) 

# Conceptual Note on Identification & Verification
## Voter Identification, Voting-Office Identification, And One-Time-Pads
One way of looking at the use of one-time-pads when voting (entirely setting aside the topic of online or computer networks) is that having the voter (and the voting-office) produce a one-time pad during registration for use during an election the same as issuing a voter a form of voter-id (and also giving the voting-office a verification id that the voter can check). There are various advantages to using a one-time pad over a declaratory-seal-of-much-specialness or other fuzzy form of identification. Anyone can counterfeit a 'super-special-seal' (as on a coin, or a wax imprint), but you cannot counterfeit a matching one-time-pad. And the one-time-pad can be used with the same robustness whether it is in-person, a paper envelope in the mail, by telegraph or telephone, or over a network like the internet.

### Social Engineering
Like anything else, 'social engineering' and physical disruption are not prevented by a one-time-pad or a voter id. If the earth is destroyed by an asteroid, or a person is murdered or dies, or a voting office is hit by a tornado, or a persuasive neighbor influences and convinces the voter to not participate in the upcoming election by their own individual adult choice, or if there is too severe a weathering and erosion of institutions between which there are checks and balances leaving extreme ignorant volatility to lurch systems into collapse, these issues cannot be solved as part of solving the solve-able problems of verification and identification. Just as coordinating decisions in projects should not have a single point of failure, there is no single minimal function that is equivalent to architectures in contexts with multiple categories of diverse participants and institutions, however cumbersome or premature it may be to define individuals, participants, and institutions.

# Proposed Steps for Secure Online Voting
This section is primarily a proof of concept, though it should be possible to implement. The emphasis here is on best-practice process, not on maximum convenience or maximum time-resource cost efficiency. So while this model may not be ideal to use directly in all situations, it may be seen (provided tests and audits) as an ideal to not stray too far from. 

## Rules & Assumptions (For Conceptual-Ideal Election)
- Rule/Assumption 1: There is a physical voting-office, just as there would be in the case of an all-paper election.

- Rule/Assumption 2: Problems must be solved in-person with the voter present and with that voter's proof of identification in the same way that the person would register to vote (and/or cast their vote in an in-person election).  

- Rule/Assumption 3: Empirical tests, hypothetical tests, and security checks should be done to demonstrate how this (or any) voting system measurably succeeds or measurably fails to work. In some cases falsifiability may need to be a criteria for types of requirements for voting and coordination systems.
[E.g. "I just like it." or: "I just don't like it." or "It must (or must not) have undefineable_property_X." are not sufficient reasons to use or to not use a given voting process.]

- Rule/Assumption 4: Voting issues must be definable and defined in measurable and testable ways. E.g. If this system does work, disinformation will be used to prevent it from working. 

- Rule/Assumption 5: If the context is critiquing the mechanics of casting/submitting ballots and votes, then a failure to agree on design and rules for an election (e.g. doing a run-off or not doing a run-off, how proportional representation is, etc.) should not be considered relevant to the context of submitting a ballot. (E.g. complaints about how votes are counted (or ignored) should not be used as an argument against secure methods to (the context of the mechanics of) casting/submitting ballots and votes.)

## Steps (For Conceptual-Ideal Election)

#### Step 1: (During in-person Voter Registration: start registration [not-over-a-network/not-online]:) 
Before the election ends: A person, e.g. in-person, with ID (identifiable as an eligible voter according to local rules), goes to the Voting-Office to register for the vote-over-a-network (with One-Time-Pad) (online voting) process. 

(Note: There is a system-design-choice to allow (or not) registration for more than one election. This issue can be related to the format/type of the submitted ballot. For example: 
#### A. ballots that have been (or can have been) designed at the time of registration, and 
#### B. Standardized or truncated ballots containing just choices and not all the text of the ballot (possibly a choice (e.g. choice number) and the initials of the person's name as a second factor) and 
#### C. whether whatever form of ballot is customized for each voter (e.g. with a custom-id, verifiable as going to and coming from that one voter) or whether the ballot is standardized (and verifiable as the standard ballot for that election or more standardized) )

#### Step 2: (During in-person Registration: Make one-time-pads.) 
For a given single vote-ballot in a given single-election (note: multiple is another design option) there need to be four physical paper documents. One "pad" (as defined here) is two identical paper documents, one for each party (two parties, in this case: 1. The Voter and 2. The Vote-Office). Since there will be two "exchanges (people sending things to each other)" (one (1) where the blank-ballot is sent to the voter, and another (2) where the filled-in-ballot is sent by the voter to the vote-office), there need to be two pads. E.g. If the voter obtains a ballot from a compromised public ballot website or a fake website (disinformation) then that vote could be disrupted unless the problem is detected and the danger avoided.

(Alternately the voting-system could be streamlined to use only one pad for submitting a standardized public ballot, but this shorter process does not include the step for the voter to confirm that the ballot was sent by the vote-office and it also prevents the office from confirming that the ballot used was the same ballot sent by the vote-office to the voter. See below for more details.) 

Using two one-time-pads has several advantages.
To recap: one pad is for sending the voter a blank ballot (from the voting office), the second pad is for the voter to send the completed ballot to the voting office. This allows the voter to verify that the ballot they are filling out comes from the Vote-Office at which they registered, and that only someone with physical access to the physical one-time-pad created at the time and place of their registration has sent them this ballot. And this allows for a comparison by the Vote-Office, likewise, of the ballot sent and the ballot received. The benchmark for success here is for an over-a-network(online) voting system to be as-secure-as an in-person, all-paper, voting system. Just as it is possible (in theory) for a hostile group to physically take over a Vote-Office and issue people fake ballots, or send people fake mail-in ballots in the mail, this one-time-pad-vote-by-network proposal does not prevent such physical attacks on physical paper voting infrastructure. It does however create an extra layer of verifications that can be used during and after the vote takes place, which in theory could also be used to security-harden an all-in-person all-paper voting process to make it more secure and auditable (this may also relate to the use of and questions about asymmetric keys which are different from one-time-pads). (Note: Another additional or alternative method for some of these checks may be cryptographic signing (with optional multiple signatures) from trusted authorities (Vote-Office, federal or state agency, universities, 3rd party certifiers, etc). 


During the in-person one-time-pad-voter-registration: Two physical copies (e.g. QR codes printed on paper) of two one-time-pads are created (2x2 = 4 printed paper items); one set of the two pads are stored (not-over-a-network/not-online) by the local Vote-Office, the other set (pair) of one time pads is kept by the voter themselves (physically, not-over-a-network/not-online).

The software will print the one-time pads. The software will check (confirm, verify) the one-time pads. The software will erase thoroughly from memory (e.g. physically overwrite) any record of what the printed one-time-pads were.
(Note, if this process is done not-over-a-network/not-online using a dedicated machine, the risk (attack-surface) of someone being able to take (exfiltrate) the one-time-pads is reduced. Especially if the custom machine does not have enough memory to store any old pads but can only process and re-write-over one pad at a time.)

#### Step 3: (During in-person Registration: Create Encrypted Ballot) 
For the voting-office to send one ballot to one voter:
The election office, not-over-a-network/not-online (enforced by software), uses the first 1:2 of the pair of printed QR codes to create an 'encrypted' version of the ballot for that one voter. 
Note: The ballot may be public, but it still needs to be verified. This illustrates the "verification" role sometimes lumped together with "security" and "encryption." The emphasis is not on 'hiding' the public ballot form, but on verifying that the specific ballot form that the voter is filling out is (identical to) the form that the local election office gave them.

Note: It may be desirable to have a 'verified public ballot' as opposed to a 'private ballot' which in theory could vary (for security and verification) from the standard public ballot (in a context of mapping out a potential attack space). 
In the case that a truncated-submitted ballot is used, some way may be desired to, e.g. make a short hash of the original ballot itself (e.g. to convert the ballot by OCR or perhaps have a QR code on the ballot (though a QR on a ballot received by a voter code could be forged, whereas a hash made by the voter of the whole ballot could not be). Perhaps having a multi-pass OCR hash of a public ballot submitted with the vote to indicate that the correct ballot was used (again, in the case of a truncated submission, for a full ballot return the whole ballot is there)(also see asymmetric signing keys). 
It may be possible to have both a public verified 'open' ballot format and some unique element for the voter to check that the ballot comes from the Vote-Office with the voters one-time-pad (such as a unique id code at the bottom or top of the ballot)


#### Step 4: (Voter Gets Not-Yet-Completed Ballot over-a-network) 
During the election period (be that months, weeks, days, hours, etc.), a one-time-pad 'encoded' ballot is sent [from the voting-office to the voter] by whatever agreed upon ("electronic" or non-paper) method (website, email, SMS-text, mobile-app, S3, api-endpoint, etc.) in the form of a QR code.
(note: document vs. .csv file format)

Note: As an example method for a 'personalized ballot,' a randomized process of frame-shifting the ballot so that where exactly on the page each person's vote-choices appears is random, increasing the entropy of the unique ballot (e.g. so that the voting-office can increase confidence that the ballot they receive back from the voter is the one they set). 

Note: Public Ballot vs. Private Ballot vs. Hybrid
1. Public 'open' ballots over a network and verifiable, maybe multi-factor verifiable. (Asymmetric signed by voting office, asymmetric signed by other trusted groups: ngo, university, sister cities, etc. The idea being that 'multi-factor' significantly increases the difficulty of attack; a public open-ledger ballot on a block-chain type system may also be either an alternative or another multi-factor. 
2. Send the vote (or allow them to download) a private ballot (or a public ballot)

Note: Another type of hybrid approach is to physically hand out general or unique ballots at the ballot office to the voter in-person, in the same process where the voter registers to vote.


#### Step 5: (Voter Receives the not-yet-completed ballot [over-a-network]) 
Voter Receives Ballot online.

(Note: There is a choice here between using a public standardized ballot or a per-person ballot (e.g. with a unique id number or such, to verify that the ballot-form sent was the same as that received, or a short-form vote which contains just the choices and not all the text of the ballot.)


#### Step 6: (Decrypt and print ballot [not-over-a-network/not-online])
Using one piece of software, the voter not-over-a-network/not-online (enforced by software, possibly hardware) 'decrypts' the ballot.


#### Step 7:(Print Ballot [not-over-a-network/not-online])
physically prints the decrypted ballot


#### Step 8: (Validate the not-yet-completed Ballot [not-over-a-network/not-online]) 
The voter not-over-a-network/not-online(enforced by software), inspects and validates that their digital scanned version of their not-yet-filled-out-ballot is the correct ballot-form intended for that election (e.g. not a tampered with or accidentally incorrect ballot). There are various and possibly multiple ways to check this (elaboration pending).

(Note: possibly the validity of the ballot could or should be checked during both steps)


#### Step 9: (Complete/Mark/Fill-in the Ballot with Vote-Choices [not-over-a-network/not-online]) 
The voter, not-over-a-network/not-online(using pen and paper), fills out the ballot (selecting their vote choices). (Details here may be important in some way: filling in a circle, selecting an option number, multi-factor, non-over-under-voting checks, etc.)


#### Step 10: (Digitize the Completed Ballot not-over-a-network/not-online] ) 
The voter, not-over-a-network/not-online (enforced by software), scans (e.g. by taking a picture) the completed-filled-in paper ballot, creating not a photo but a document or table of information (so that the one-time-pad can convert character by character). 
(Note: maybe some kind of mono-space font and dashes between lines to avoid spacing errors?) 


#### Step 11: (Check Completed-Ballot for Errors [not-over-a-network/not-online]) 
The voter confirms that the information in their (the voter's)  electronic scanned ballot is the same as the paper version of their (the voter's) filled out ballot. (Checking for errors.) (Note: Automated processes for checking ballots for standard mistakes.)

~ Step: An optional but recommended intermediate step here is to have a 3rd set of not-over-a-network/not-online-only software that will check the ballot before and or after it is filled out by the voter, such that this additional set of software can check for the "overvoting" (voting for both candidates) and "undervoting" (voting for neither candidate) issues as a safeguard (against accidentally-incorrectly filled-out-and-submitted ballots) and that perhaps Nevada has used successfully. 

Question: Is there a way to optimize OCR? e.g. letter per box format? Alternatives to OCR?
- various ocr applications that can be used
- open source
- safety, reliability issues

(end of reference)

Another ~'multifactor' check may be to both mark a vote-choice on the ballot also and give some information about that choice, e.g. mark candidate 2 and in a second field enter the first letter of that candidate's last name. If these do not match, the voter should be alerted to check their ballot selections.
The voter, not-over-a-network/not-online(enforced by software), scans (e.g. by taking a picture) the filled-out paper ballot.  
(Question: ...print formats...)


#### Step 12: (Encrypt the Ballot [not-over-a-network/not-online]) 
The voter, not-over-a-network/not-online(enforced by software), uses the one-time-pad to 'encrypt' the completed ballot, producing a new QR code (which is then 'encrypted' ballot). All digital files of the unencrypted ballot are removed and the memory physically over-written on the voter's device. The paper copy of the voter's ballot can be saved for evidence or destroyed for privacy based on the voter's choice. (Note: signing signatures can be used with the printed ballot or QR-code to increase confidence that the ballot is authentic. This combines advantages of asymmetric encryption along with a physical printed paper trail for audits.)


#### Step 13: (Voter Submits Encrypted-ballot Over-a-Network) 
Online: The voter sends their completed-ballot-QR-code (containing the voter's encrypted filled-in and checked ballot) to the local election office (sent by whatever agreed upon method (website, email, text, messaging software, shared storage (e.g. S3), api-endpoint, etc.)).


#### Step 14: (Initial Handling of Voter's Encrypted Ballot [Over-a-Network])
The local election office physically prints onto paper the QR code for the 'encrypted' filled out ballot, and then (double) checks (compares) to confirm that the physical print (of the electronically-sent QR code) is accurate/identical (to the QR code submitted by the voter), and (if printing is accurate) deletes the digital record and the memory is physically over-written.
1. Print
2. Check
3. Delete
 
##### Note: This step will most likely be done on a "computer" that is connected to a "network."


#### Step 15: (Processing the Voter-Submitted Ballot [not-over-a-network / not-online])
not-over-a-network/not-online, using a separate piece of software, the local election office "decrypts" the QR code for the 'encrypted' completed(choices-filled-in) ballot using the second(2:2) of the pair of printed (pad)QR codes for the one-time pad, and physically prints on paper the voter's filled-in ballot. 
(Note: one choice in designing the software is to directly-print-to-paper or to decrypt and display on a screen or possible save as a computer file)
The voter's completed ballot is stored along with any completed paper ballot (e.g. mail-in ballots, or paper ballots delivered in person or filled out in person).
(Note: Depending on the details, an additional step may be needed to convert the format of the QR code (or abridged format) to the same format as an in-person ballot. For example, if only the vote choice data are recorded in the QR code (or abridged format) the exact placement of each printed character on paper may be needed or useful for manual or automated ballot counting).

Question: How much data can a QR code contain? 
Question: How redundant can a QR be for error-correction?

Question: Other pros and cons of qr codes?

Note: If the ballot is processed on an not-over-a-network/not-online not-connected to a network computer then the chances of 'hacking' the vote are reduced (the 'attack surface' is reduced). 

Enter voter data into the election-results-data-set.


#### Step 16: (Process Election Data / Count The Votes)
The printed ballot is counted with the other paper ballots of various kinds during the normal election ballot count process.


#### Step 17: (Publish Election-Results Data)
The election results are processed and published.
(The publication of election results is perhaps not strictly part of the question of 'secure voting' but in practice it is likely often a requirement.)


# Information-Entropy, One time pads, old pads, and random number generation.
 
The neglected topic of entropy often comes back to byte us. If:
If someone wishes to save old one-time-pads(e.g. QR-codes). Or: If someone does not dispose of old one-time-pads(e.g. QR-codes). And: If one-time-pads(e.g. QR-codes) were not generated in a sufficiently random way, then by studying a collection of old one-time-pads(e.g. QR-codes) that were generated using a not-sufficiently-random process it could be possible (or even trivial) to 'hack' the one-time-pad(e.g. QR-code) generation process and thereby be able to disrupt many parts of the voting system.


Note: 2025.04.24

# Risks, Attacks & Security

## Identifying Risks 
Here we look at risks from bad-actors or bad-agents. A bad-agent may be human or automated, may be local or non-local agents such as foreign states / groups. (As of 2022 ransomware is popular, and it is possible that an election system could be targeted e.g. for ransom, so designing a distributed and attack resistant framework may be important.)
An 'agent' may be anything from a single person to a group of people to an AI-bot, software suit, malware software, ransomware software, thinktank, etc. (or something unclear and not simple to identify) (note: other areas of risks should be explored, and may include: 
-1. Constant 'internet background radiation'
-2. Unintentional user-misuse
-3. Unintentional administrative bungling
-4. Oversights and biases (e.g. setting up a voting system and obsessing so much over absolutely obscure vote secrecy that vote auditing and best practice domestic and international observation of the vote process is impeded, impracticable, or impossible)
-5. practical feasibility vs. ideals in principle (possibly similar to "letting the perfect be the enemy of the good') 
-6. Software design problems that cause time, logistical, or reliability problems
-7. Etc.

Note: It may be important to consider both (unsuccessful) attempted-attacks and successful attacks. An unsuccessful attempted-attack should likely be considered important and not ignored simply because it was not entirely successful. E.g. possibly considering attack-attempts to be the unit in attack-space, not successful-attacks. 

## Bad-agents
1. A bad-agent will intercept one-time-pads:

1.1 - The agent would need to be physically in the room during the QR code creation, to break into the gov. office, or to physically steal from the person, without anyone knowing the QR codes were stolen. 

1.2 - The one-time-pads are never stored digitally anywhere, but are only physically printed by an not-over-a-network/not-online computer.

1.3 - If the voter loses the QR code the person should cancel the process.

2. A bad-agent will send the voter a fake blank-ballot:
- additional step: there can be additional checks such as a passphrase chosen by the person which could not be electronically surveilled from any computer (e.g. written in pen on the QR pad) 

3. A bad-agent will send the voting system a fake filled-in ballot (pretending to be the voter):

- 3.1  The bad-agent would need to have both stolen QR codes and a stolen ballot that was sent to the voter.

- 3.2  If a voter loses the QR code then that voter should cancel/restart the process.
	
4. A bad-agent will record a fake record of the vote from the ballot:
- while a possible risk, depending on the online-voting system this process (a fake record of the vote from the ballot) is the same as for any paper ballot.
Variants:
- change existing record
- corrupt original-record-creation process (bugs and loopholes in design)
- manually interfere physically in vote office during process putting in false information
- social engineering attack to the same end (e.g. impersonating a voter, pole worker, technician, etc.)


5. A bad-agent will act on the behalf of a participant without the voter's participation:
- cast a vote
- cancel or change registration
- try to register or get registration information

6. A bad-agent will act on the behalf of the voting office without the voting-office's participation.

7. A bad-agent will attempt to tamper with a public ballot (e.g. a ballot itself, e.g. downloading a ballot to use).

8. A bad-agent will attempt to tamper with public ballot-confirmation information (e.g. public information posted about the ballot by the voting office, describing and understanding the ballot and ballot issues).

9. A bad-agent will attempt to tamper with voting instructions and information about voting procedures.

10. A bad-agent will attempt to tamper with vote reporting including any information put out by a Vote-Office or similar authority.

11. A bad-agent will attempt to disrupt the sending and receiving of vote information (including but not restricted to blank and filled-in ballots (e.g. voting times, places, registration, ballot items, etc). 

12. A bad-agent will attempt general or specific disinformation attacks that negatively impact the overall voting and election processes and systems. 

13. A bad agent will attempt to disrupt or disperse the population or geography of a vote (creating a need for refugee voting). 

14. A bad agent will attempt to gain access to a system (network, server, etc.) as a goal in and of itself: e.g. to then sell or transfer that access to a separate attacker-agent.

15. A bad-agent will attempt to lurk undetected in the target system indefinitely, waiting and planning for a good time to act. (APT?) (see: canary; see: living off the land)

16. A bad-agent will attempt to re-purpose the voting system for their own uses.

17. A bad-agent will attempt to disrupt access to the voting tools and processes, from enrollment to voting to results reporting and verification.

18. A bad-agent will attempt to disrupt the network.

19. A bad agent may behave in ways that are indeterminately incompetent and malicious. 

20. A bad-agent will attempt social engineering attacks.

21. A bad-agent will use disinformation.

22. A bad-agent will attempt to disrupt infrastructure that the election relies upon (electricity, post office, transportation, new-media, schools, etc.).

23. A bad-agent will attempt, or otherwise effect, the disruption or prevention of the study and communication of the security, data-hygiene, or safe-use, etc., of a feature, product, item, use, context, noun, verb, etc. 


(note: There are bad agents but there are also other cases and factors which at times should not be confused with bad agents. For example a tester/developer whose goal is to find and fix issues working with other developers is not a bad agent. There are various appropriate and inappropriate factors in different contexts, not everyone can be divided into bad agents and innocent users. And the details and edge cases can become tricky to manage clearly and optimally. )

## Description & Overview of Process-in-Principle
This is a proposed process for reasonably secure 'online (over a network) voting.' Part of this design is that the entire process is not on-line. Rather, physical printed materials and not-over-a-network/not-online computers are used to reduce the online attack surface. A person or bad-agent can feasibly steal or tamper with a file in a network-connected computer from a remote location, but a person or bad-agent cannot feasibly/easily tamper with or steal documents in a filing cabinet or from a computer connected to the internet. This particular solution is not a perfect-for-all-cases solution. E.g. This will not be easy to use for persons who cannot ever travel themselves to a gov. office or polling place. 

The primary focus of this report is the question of whether casting a ballot/vote over-a-network(online) can in principle be done with sufficient security and soundness. Secondarily, this report explores 'practical and thrifty' variations which add in factors of feasibility, cost, equipment availability, and other real-world factors that communities around the world may face in actually holding an election (i.e. not everyone has ideal funding and resources with which to carry out the perfect election). Another way to look at this distinction is that we first look at an ideal voting system to aim for, and then look at realistic voting systems. 


## Implementation & Secure Voting
(see practical implementation as separate after proof of concept implementation)
These are recommendations for a reasonably secure online voting system that should not be significantly more cumbersome than a physical paper voting system. 

To improve accessibility, it is conceivable that some local voting systems would prefer to simplify some of the security step to allow broader accessibility:
- voters who have no access to a printer
- voters who cannot physically travel (e.g. elderly persons in retirement home or hospital), perhaps allowing a proxy to carry documents for that person.

- institutions large or small such as retirement homes or other such community organizations are well placed to be involved where voters are not physically able to travel to poles. 

- Military overseas are another important group of voters who are both not physically able to travel overseas yet often close to bodies of administration and organization who can facilitate voting.  

- Coordinated Decisions for Field-Research
-- data-informed decision making
-- testing decision proposals
-- modeling decision outcomes

# Security Section
### Additional steps can be taken to increase security. 
#### For example: 
1. To reduce the possibility that local staff will accidentally connect to the internet or run the software on insecure or already compromised hardware, it should be possible to create a cost effective system where staff will run a custom made operating system (custom BSD or Linux or FreeDOS, etc.) that lacks the ability to use the internet. It may also be possible to use cost effective hardware such as a raspberry pi or microcontrollers. There may be safety advantages to using micro-controllers that lack overall computer abilities and thereby lack security risks associated with those.

2. Put safeguards into the software to at least try to prevent using the same one-time-pad more than once. 

3. Known issues and areas:
- memory issues: use memory safe languages
- fonts: restrict and regulate character-set use
- communications and fishing: don't use insecure systems such as email, SMS texts, http, ftp, etc.


## Unique Ballots
At this time or at a later time [a printed copy of a unique ballot] (depending on choice, timing, etc. (e.g. if the ballot has been decided which is often not the case at the time of voter registration or if in terms of security level if the voter does not trust a physical breaking of the vote office and wants in advance a verifiable ballot) (not-over-a-network/not-online) a printed copy of a unique ballot (e.g. containing if not the voter's name the equivalent of a sha256 hash of the unique ballot). Either a unique ballot or a unique ballot identification number will be used on both ends, by the voter to check that the ballot they receive is authentic and by the office that the ballot received completed and sent by the voters is authentic. (Note: some combination of a 'signed' public ballot and a signed sender/recipient may also be possible)
(todo: list pros and cons of using unique ballots (per voter)


## Challenges:
One area that may cause issues is if the office or voter is 'unable' to scan or take a clear photo of the document, in the same way that some people are 'unable' (which ranges from people having legitimate physical or mental handicaps to people not bothering to try) to take a clear picture of their check for their bank (so a less secure non-printed option may be desired in some cases).
It is also possible that OCR (optical character recognition) may not be good enough to perform a computer-automated visual reading of a printed paper ballot, but given the use of OCR to read more obscurely printed checks, sloppily written mailing addresses on envelopes, etc., this is possibly not a terminal obstacle. 
#### (note: .csv files may have a standardizing role here) 
#### (note: writing characters in a grid may have a standardizing role here) 

Note: It might be possible to make a kind of hybrid document solution. There can be a QR code that gives template and instruction information as to what the fields are, then items selected (boxes filled, or circles filled in) can be identified without the use of OCR. In the case of write-in ballot areas, there may be various factors that make OCR 'good enough.' e.g. if any candidate receives enough write-in votes, that situation will make that popular name a more likely candidate for matching in the case of mostly illegible scrawling. And having one letter per box may also help legibility for write-in names. 

The task of automated ballot-reading perhaps should be steered away from subtle character recognition of natural-language phrases and towards clear, easily defined, targets such as a binary check-box selection. An exception to this may be write-in ballots which do occur, where some other system may be needed (binary as in: checked-box vs. not-checked-box).
Though even here, OCR and having the vote double-check to see that the OCR is correct may be sufficient. 
(Note: The direct use of .csv files may be ideal. CSV files can also account for write-in and other edge cases. Any 'field' to fill in can simply be included either as an item in the same row and or as a column heading).


## About One Time Pads
A one-time-pad is not the same as a re-use-able 'code.' A re-use-able code 'encodes' a signal and is re-used, such that 'breaking the code' will allow decrypting the document. A one-time-pad is different; a unique one-time-pad is used only one time. A one-time-pad is a one-for-one set of changes for every character in the document, each completely random, with no pattern, and each one-time-pad is used only one-time. Even in principle you cannot 'break' a one-time pad however much you examine the encrypted document (unless the one-time-pad itself is somehow defective: to be a real one time pad it must be used only once and it must be unique and random).  Unfortunately, the terminology can be overlapping and a bit unclear between the reusable codes and one-time-pads. For example, the terms 'encode' and 'decode' may be used in both cases, and the overall process and purpose is usually similar or the same. 

Historically, a 'one time pad' was literally a pair of identical physical paper note-pads, two notebooks, with the same set of characters on corresponding pages 1,2,3 etc. in both notebooks. By analogy this is like two copies of the same book (such as two identical copies and identical editions of Alice in Wonderland), with the same exact characters on the same numbered page of each book). Each code (e.g. each page) was used only one time, hence the term "one-time-pad". In summary: a pair of identical physical paper note-pads, each page of which was used only one time: a "one time pad."

With a one-time-pad, every character (letter, number, symbol, etc.) in the document that you are encrypting is individually changed using just one character in the [one time]pad. There is no predetermining pattern or system behind the sequence of changes resulting from using a one-time-pad that can be outsmarted or 'cracked.' The only way to 'decode' a one-time-pad 'encrypted' message is with that one-time-pad; a one-time-pad is a one-by-one, one-for-one, one character at a time, change of what the original text says. There is no key. There is no password. There is no equation. There is no shortcut. Every character or unit of the entire document is individually changed into something else in an independent way. 

One-time-pads are not as efficient and user-friendly as shorter and or 're-use-able' codes in some ways, but one-time-pads are more secure and more simple. Because there is no 'key,' there is no possibility in principle to 'guess the key.' The one-time-pad must be as long as the original text itself, unlike a 'password' or short 'key' that might be only eight characters long. 


#### Low-Tech Security & Limited-Resources
Question: Is there a lower-tech version with reasonable security for geographic locations with limited resources?

Often fewer features and narrower footprint and attack-surface increase security, but in a system starting entirely with paper and pencil, in this case the meaning of 'less' may require more explanation. 

Details: The first part of this report is a more abstract proof-of-concept about whether one-time-pad voting over a network is any less secure than one-time-pad secured voting over-a-network. However, in reality actual voters and voting-offices may refuse to use an ideal secure voting system (for reasons legitimate or illegitimate). It is entirely within keeping with computer science that there are multiple possible solutions to a problem, and while one solution may be perfectly fine in theory it is simply not practical or feasible to implement (often: requiring too many resources (including time as a resources), either relatively too many (resources-required) compared to another solution or too many as in that requirement simply cannot be met with known technology (e.g. taking a length of time longer than the age of the universe to solve the problem: in principle: problem solved! in practical reality: problem not solved.)). There should be a discussion of what a good-enough solution is, and how a good-enough solution may meet the practical demands of users.

# Part 2: Practical Secure Online Voting
### Goal: Practical version of 'online voting' for realistic implementation
('online voting' is likely an easy to understand common term for a more general and abstract process of automated networked project decision coordination with broad applications.)

There is a difference between only the step of casting a vote being done online-over-a-network (to get the advantages of votes being cast from anywhere during a longer time-frame), and the entire election being held online, over-a-network. There are advantages and disadvantages to an online, de-centered, open-source, election-system. Advantages:
- open source
- audit-able
- test-able
- faster
- cheaper
- available to oppressed and under-represented groups
- modular: voting and election do not only happen during governmental elections, that is just one instance of a more general process. 

####  Some voting locations (or regions) may not have: 
1. printers, ink, and paper
2. extra air-gapped computers
3. a physical location to securely store paper files
4. broadband wireless internet
5. a find-able standardized address for voters to find
6. a safe location to vote

#### Most locations can be assumed to have and required to have:
1. basic mobile phones
2. basic (not high speed) internet access

Writing down the numbers and confirming with a photo (no printers needed) may be able to replace a printed QR code system while still having a paper-backup form, if only as an option (e.g. you cannot hack into and change a piece of paper). 

A separate air-gapped mobile device would be feasible, or perhaps a more decentralized system would be more secure.
(note: 'certificate' model)

# An alternative thrifty-protocol for resource-limited situations/geographies 
(section under construction)

## Practical Voting

Q: double signed interaction, with public and private key from both parties...
from the 'election' to show you were allowed to vote (unless open to anyone)
and verified by voter...
...maybe during remote registration...
a swap of confirmed signatures..
Q: who is who over network...

The goal here (for this practical-tool section, vs. the above secure voting in principle) is more a practical-project and less abstract (proof of concept or standard-setting): How can a local community organize and carry out a best-practice auditible vote and publish the results using (widely available and) accessible technology (such as mobile phones)?

What are some of the factors that characterize a realistically resource-limited situation? Are there some general groups of common sets of constraints? E.g. Some groups may have a safe place for a voting office but no funds for extra equipment. Other groups may not have a safe place for any voting office or official positions (needing the management of the election to be virtual and decentralized). 

Question: Can virtual distributed elections be best carried out with or without support from institutions such as universities? Or more generally, what roles do 'institutions' including legal institutions, have with a fundamentally STEM/math/engineering process of carrying out and publishing the results of elections which have no reliance upon culture or belief and yet the results of which for practicality must be integrated with the 'social' system that is voting? (probably a bad analogy example: you do not need social institutions to measure the temperature of the (for example) the air, but without 'institutions' around standards and measures and even media of communication it would be infeasible to physically or intellectually communicate and use that measurement-data. (E.g. go back in time a million years: you could measure the temperature of the air just fine, but how would you usefully-communicate that temperature-information to STEM-institution-less-communities of people and how would they use that information?)

Thrifty voting systems may make more use of available multi-factor authentication and less use of equipment-expensive methods (such as dedicated printing and scanning machines). 

Depending on the details of the situation, there may be some option for physical printed documents, but there will most likely be more use of non-paper methods for a thrifty resource-slim and more user-friendly system, for example in cases where there is no possible way to use physical documents. 

Other methods such as chains-of-trust may be useful to harden thrifty online systems.?

#### General Revisions for Thrifty-Secure-Voting:
1. use-able with only standard mobile devices possessed by voters
2. no physical printed copies, so a change from OCR and paper documents to basic characters in a file. 
3. no separate air-gapped hardware
4. one pad per set of elections vs. two pads per single election (backup pads?)
5. more cryptographic signature use?



#### Topic/idea: use of one time pads plus signing signatures
#### use and issues with signing certificates
#### feasibility of one time pads: attack surface of initial sharing

#### Notes:
- individual permission drop-off folders (cloud storage like S3)
- anonymized ballots (storing data without direct connection to user information)
- face-picture when sending in vote
- vote by phone system, tied to that phone...(note: if you lose the phone)
- 'done by voter' means voter-side-software vs. vote-system/voting-office-side-software, not necessarily manually done. e.g. automated error checking. (better terms probably needed)

## Ballot format standardization?
- csv format: pads, ballots, votes
- data format / presentation format 
- character type...ascii?


# Proposed Steps for Practical Secure Online Voting (section under construction)

For a voting system to be practical, the requirements for implementation and assumptions about what resources voters have must align and align with reality. 

#### This thrifty-and-pragmatic (if not perfect) system does NOT assume:
- that there is a voting office either as a building or as human staff
- that voting-areas can afford any equipment beyond voters having mobile phones
- that a voting-area can afford a large staff to manage the election
- that there are institutions for safe and secure elections


#### Step 1: (Election-Setup: [over-a-network / online]) 
- scheduling
- enrollment
- standards protocols methods and procedures
- 

#### Step 2: (Voter-Setup: During online registration time period [over-a-network / online]) 
Before the election ends: A voter registers for the vote-over-a-network (with One-Time-Pad) (online voting) process. 
This may be done entirely online for most-practical voting, or other elements may be added.
(Note: setup questions for entirely online vote: How list of voters is selected or checked. Voter identification online... In theory the same online system as for current voter-registration may be used and considered sufficient.)

For entirely-online-voting there is the challenge of selecting who on the internet may participate. 
A kind of hybrid may involve e.g. sending snail-mailed to voters (or picked up with ID from an office) to use to authenticate their online connection. 
note: using signing-signatures

While the thrifty/pragmatic-protocol is designed to avoid extra printer hardware, the option still exists to hand-write one-time pads, which for an election with fewer than five or 10 choices on the ballot would be practical to write down on wallet sized note (and check electronically (OCR) to make sure it is correct). 
A short-form ballot one-time-pad good for several ballots may be hand written and OCR-checked on a wallet-card sized card or paper.

(Question: How reliable is OCR? Is OCR reliability an issue? Is this a strong argument for all-digital and no-conversion process? (can still be printed or saved records etc.)

A short-form or truncated ballot may contain:
e.g.
- the number of the option-choice and perhaps 
- a first/last letter in the candidate's name (which could also serve as a check, similar to an empty choice check, if the name-letter does not agree with the number option). 
(also a check against a vote left empty?)
Note: Write-in may be an issue for the truncated ballot. 

#### Note: Ways to make sure a one-time-pad is not being used a 2nd time...a log of already used one-time-pads to check against...?...or a small hash?

The idea of a non-recoverable system, disposable, that you would restart if something went wrong, but no back-doors, side doors, etc.
voter...re-register...multiple registrations?

note: https://sqrl.grc.com/pages/getting_started_with_sqrl/ 

Question: one time pads vs. signing keys for transmitting ballots
Also: multiple party signing keys?


#### Step 3: Voter Obtains Ballot Online
#### 3 options:
1. a publicly posted signed ballot (verifiable)
2. a ballot including a unique personal id sent only to that one person 
3. both
4. some kind of redundancy and checking between sources and agreement of online ballots. (e.g. .edu hosting, or distributed software held by voters?)

During the election period (be that months, weeks, days, hours, etc.), a one-time-pad 'encoded' ballot is sent by whatever agreed upon method (website, email, text, snapchat, S3, api-endpoint, etc.) in the form of another QR code.
Part of this process is an at-the-time randomized process of frame-shifting the ballot so that the location on the page where each person's vote-choices appear is random. 

  
#### Step 4: (Voter Gets the not-yet-completed Ballot)  
Optional ways to do this:
- A. posted on several public sites and signed and can be compared/verified
- B. collecting from (and perhaps compared across) various sources by voting software, e.g. a minimal and secure mobile device software application ("app")
(For the most-resource efficient system, individually sending personalized ballots should perhaps be avoided. Question: What are the factors around this? Does a ballot need to be individualized? How does it need to be individualized?)


#### Step 5: (Voter Validate the not-yet-completed Ballot) 
The voter on-line inspects and validates the ballot. Most likely by checking and comparing multiple sources,possibly signing keys, maybe multiple signing certificates. There could be both manual and automatic options to balance ease of use with manual thoroughness. 
(note: Finding universities to host copies of the final ballot may be a good option. But this step may not be feasible or necessary.) (Something like a blockchain (immutable ledger) for all users of the voting system may suffice as a good-enough decentered immutable portable verified storage system.)


#### Step 6: (Voter Completes the Ballot, Marks Votes) 
e.g. csv format of data (vs. pdf type doc)
Question: id such as biometric data?

~ step: an optional intermediate step here is to have a 3rd set of not-over-a-network/not-online-only software that will check the ballot before and or after it is filled out by the voter, such that this additional set of software can check for the "overvoting" (voting for both candidates) and "undervoting" (voting for neither candidate) issues as a safeguard (against accidentally-incorrectly filled-out-and-submitted ballots) and that perhaps Nevada has used successfully.

#### Step 7: (Check Completed-Ballot for Errors [done by voter]) 
- sanitizing inputs
- adversarial inputs
- impossible options (more than one option selected where only one can be)
- no-vote blanks 
- too few for multiple selections, possiby make vote choices clear so that one selection is required for each question.
- test-process errors (something breaks processing)


#### Step 8: (Encrypt the Completed-Ballot [done by voter]) 
Details depend on the file system being used.
Question: If an anonymized blockchain system is used, is there a need to encrypt the submitted ballot? e.g. could the ballot have an anonymized id?


#### Step 9: (Voter Submit encrypted-ballot over network) 
Question: recommended methods?
Some kind of MFA? 
immutable ledger system?
	- frozen ledger (duplicated with hash checks)
	- dynamic ledger 
Online: The voter sends (by whatever agreed upon method (website, email, text, snapchat, S3, api-endpoint, etc.)) the new QR code (containing their encrypted filled-in-and-checked ballot) to the local election office.


#### Step 10: (Process the Encrypted Voter-Submitted Ballot)
- thrifty encryption choice?
Arguably this is a key area if one-time-pads are not being used, or not in the same way as the proof-of-concept. 
- format of ballot
(file format: csv?)
(voter checks on status?)
- decrypt
- data-entry: vote into system
- an advantage, possibly a significant one, is the ability to skip optical text recognition and keep all data in a stable digital format.


#### Step 11: (Process Election Data / Count The Votes)
(storage: distributed? immutable-ledger?)

#### Step 12: (Publish Election Vote-Results-Data)
- automated?
- what to anonymize?

#### Step 13: (Publish Full Election Report)
- documentation on system architecture
- policies
- rules
- enrollment
- method of vote-counting
- security audit of system
- security audit of election
- questionnaires and poles
- rules for margins, recounts, challenges, runoffs, etc.
- open source system code
- anonymized election results
- election schedule


# Notes:
#### Question: Background tests and checks during the whole process?

#### (election-results publishing...parts of process)
- for whom
- overview
- winners according to rules?
- types of analysis
- description of system
- open source code

#### Note: It is not clear that saving the QR codes serves any function, nor is there any need to carefully dispose of a QR code after it is used (if each is only used once). 

#### What kind of software (singular or plural) would be needed to arrange a secure election?

#### Voting and the byzantine general problem

#### Immutable-Ledger Data-Structures (blockchains): 
- Could some form of blockchain constructed by election participants be used as a decentered election results platform? 
- General record and evidence chains. (admittance of observers, reports, events, etc.)
- Note: while 'blockchains' per-se have gotten a lot of bad press, there are various ways to accomplish the goal of having distributed redundancy. 

#### Resilience: 
One strategy: Part of an online system may be to increase the number of channels by which people can try to vote, and possibly have a backup-pad. Thereby, if bad-agents shut down the main channel for sending in votes (which may be a single point of failure) the process will not be disrupted.

Is there a formal way to map the attack-surface areas of, and to compare, different systems of voting?

# Best Practice Examples
- never record any private information in an internet or public exposed system, e.g. use a random id.

- managing open source development best practice

#### Question: A. What is the relationship between secure end-to-end messaging and voting systems? B. Provenance: What is the relationship between origin-verification of files (including media files) and voting systems?


### Issue/Task: user interface for setting up an election



## Features Tools & Deployment
(2025.01.03)
- What are the minimal needed features?
- What are the minimal tools needed for those features?

## Question: Standardized .csv ballot format (for decision coordination): ideal?
including information about the ballot
signing key information
possible vote customization information
vote choices
etc.
Question: ways to make sure the .csv ballot is not mis-read or garbled
e.g. maybe including item number, vote choice, and first letter/number of vote choice name in the vote, may prevent arbitrary misinterpretation of votes
Question: possible requiring of ballot being completely filled out
- digital signature etc.
- checksum etc.

# Data
## maintainable operations
## Sustainable data operations:
(rows and columns?/.csv-db?)
- minimal, modular, maintainable functionalities, features, and tools
- modular database units
## maintainable system tool and techstack
- history of tool, hardware, os, software, dependency, extinction
- history of maintainability, vulnerability, performance issues


## guidelines and standards for maintainability

# training for managing maintainable project spaces
- simulations
- testing and evaluation
- breaking down skill areas such as foundational 'identification'
## project settings and configurations:
- should have theory-of-mind/sally-anne skills (true/false)
- alignment on projects scope is default/automatic (true/false)
- churn is neutral/good (true/false)
- communication about project scope is neurtral/bad (true/false)
### issue simulation
- churn
- panic
- abstraction fantasism

## Data Formats Data Structures externalization serialization and read-able serialization
- it may be important for data structures such as dictionaries of lists (to use the python terms) to be able to be exteranlized,shared and loaded and stored in a read-able printable format.
- non-transparent, non-inspectable, none-step-trace-able formats may be optimized for computation but not suitable for a system where communication is the highest priority
- externalization without binary serialization
- maybe field length and type meta-data handling

## automating speaking-time at event such as debates
- defining and classifying bad actors

## types of bytes in coordination data
- pre-empting type conversion issues

## Practical Model 2:
Similar to baseline secure model with these changes.
1. allows registered phone number use:
- ballots can be exchanged by ~sms or 
- possible voice print ID: e.g. similar to online-voter 
- registration credentials

### Practical Model 3:
Use of block chain ledger

### Practical Model 4:

speculation: ways of using smart contracts as a framework for parts of the election?
Is technology mature enough?
Security issues?

### practical model 5:
Using existing online registration systems

A note on election security and registration security: 
Does it make sense to have lower security standards around registration for voting than casting of votes? A similar or perhaps identical question is: Does it make sense to have a less security system for registration than for voting? E.g. in Pennsylvania in 2022 you can register to vote and change your party-registration, address, etc., on a simple website with no additional security, no MFA multi factor authentication, no personal in face verification, no biometrics, no mailing address sent verification, etc. And I have never heard anyone complain about the insecurity of this registration system, and a proposal to use the same system for voting immediately results in a vitriolic hyperbolic uproar of arm-waving indignation. Personally I think online registration should be more secure. My overall point here is that both registration and voting should be discussed and implemented as they relate to each-other, and not treated as if they are unrelated with inconsistent security considerations. If the standard for security is good enough for registration, that should be the same standard for voting.


# Voting, Contracts, and Smart Contracts:

Inherent in STEM is using data to identify bad-engineering acts/actions,practices,and procedures; identifying bad-engineering and best practice prevention and remediation involves values that overlap (however marginally, and with whatever nuance) with ethics, social values, team values, family values, sportsmanship, morality, civics, political philosophy, economics, and ecology. <2025 11 02>

What institutions need to officially or more-officially be part of the montesque cook adams jefferson franklin madison interlocking set of check and balance institutions? There may be a 'boot-strap' stage of minimal ~data-structures, but the overt goal is long term maintainability, and based on past data more than the bootstrap is needed (unofficially or officially) for that:
'civil society'
'academia/education / RAND'
'trade associations'
'libraries and theaters'
'STEM Standards (like NIST)'
'foreign policy ~thinktanks'
'market-exchanges with a justice-system'

## Outlining a System Literacy Curriculum:
### General accessible literacy areas:
#### Project Management
#### Decision Making
#### Data Science & Hygiene
#### System and Definition Studies
#### STEM
The goal here is to define areas of common issues as clearly as possible. We should be wary of using terms that could be defined in variable or broader ways, e.g. 'scope' 'alignment' 'goals' are quasi-synonymous for the whole exercise, so probably should not be used as the name for specific sub-parts; in real life, sometimes these broader terms are used to refer to or imply specific sub-items, sometimes this may be practical, and sometimes they may be problematically vague and indeterminate.

#### Project Areas & Problem-Examples 
#### v15
1. Process: Workflow Type, STEM Integration & Data-Definitions, Values, Agenda, Methods, Policies (including for predictable issues problems and collapse elements: scope-churn, panic-halting, planning-blackout), Coordinated Decisions, (Data/System)Ecology: Collapse & Productivity (default option: Agile, Kahneman-Tversky, Definition-Studies)
- process/policy areas may be seen as preventable-predictable-collapse-areas; each is an area of preventable mistakes that are not automatically self-preventing and that must be deliberately prevented. Problems that are not automatically visible or understandable can repeat indefinitely. Using process and policy can significantly help prevent and navigate recurring problems that are not automatically visible.
- not accounting for different workflows (e.g. frontend, backend, data-science, production machine-learning, R&D, test-reporting, etc.) will lead to delays and failures that should not have occurred. In the absence of communication and learning, these failures may be invisible and repeat indefinitely because they are not seen and understood. 
2. Schedule: (Duration; Start date; Iteration Interval)
- Timelines that need to be short but are never articulated or planned for are unlikely to usually spontaneously match the needed short scale planning needs.
- Timelines that need to be long but are never articulated or planned for are unlikely to usually spontaneously match the needed long scale planning needs.
- Undiscussed timelines risk being indeterminate, fickle, and unpredictably changing for no apparent reason, raising the risk of endemic liabilities such as churn, panic, and repeatedly returning to square one.
- Picking initial MVP goals, milestones, indicators, and both allotting and using time and resources for feedback (where that feedback is also to be used) is one location where time and schedules are deeply interwoven with other project areas.
3. Users: Stakeholders & Needs & Goals Evaluation (of users)
-- Not having and coordinating with users/stakeholders and their needs significantly raises the probability that the project will not improbably, spontaneously, meet unknown and possibly unarticulated needs of unknown people by accident.
-- A user describing their difficulties is not the same as a user outlining an ideal solution, or even accepting a viable solution.
-- Not properly doing a needs and goals evaluation significantly raises the risk of goals being either incorrectly identified, or having goals indefinitely changing or rotating between amorphous unexamined but often entirely predictable areas.
-- https://github.com/lineality/needs_goals_assessment_disambiguation
4. Features_Goals: User-Features & Subfeatures/Under-The-Hood Features including Categories of Types of Systems, Data-Types, Data-Structures, Structured Vs. Unstructured Data.(tech-stack and resources may be implicit for higher-level goals or explicit for resource-defined needs)
-- if you do not have a clear articulation of what you are doing (for a user/stakeholder to meet their clarified need) then it is unlikely that the possibly unknown goal will be accomplished in a maintainable way meeting the need of the user/stakeholder.
5. MVP: 'MVP's (Minimum Viable Products); Tools, 'Tool Stack / Tech Stack', lexicon: jargon vs. description; skills(learning)
-- an MVP must not be an invocation of a reification-hallucination 
-- iteratively proceeding with transparency and feedback to align and fine-tune is appropriate and time-tested in many projects.
-- articulating incremental MVP (minimum-viable-product) goals and stepping stones is an important part of progressing and communicating incrementally and/or progressing maintainably and sustainably. 
-- articulating incremental MVP (minimum-viable-product) goals and stepping stones is a skill in and of itself
6. Feedback_Learning: Learning, Tests, Communication, Signals, Documentation & Iteration, Organizational, System, and 'Ecological' Effects, (~agile); Documenting-teaching-learning(skills)
-- whether formal or informal there must be effective ways of communicating what has been done within the project-team and between the project-team and the user/stakeholder.
-- Failing to clearly map and communicate the differences between jargon terms and goal descriptions will result in mis-alignment between people and nonsense in planning.
-- long term maintainability involves communication (including 'future you')
-- learning directly and indirectly related to the specific project is necessary. If you do not learn that a user/stakeholder's need is not being met then long term failure is highly probable. If you continually learn and develop useful skills then long term successes are more probable.

#### Project Areas & Problem-Examples 
#### v16
1. Process: Workflow Type, STEM Integration & Data-Definitions, Values, Agenda, Methods, Policies (including for predictable issues problems and collapse elements: scope-churn, panic-halting, planning-blackout), Coordinated Decisions, (Data/System)Ecology: Collapse & Productivity (default option: Agile, Kahneman-Tversky, Definition-Studies)

2. Schedule: (Duration; Start date; Iteration Interval)
- timelines that need to be short but are never articulated or planned for are unlikely to usually spontaneously match the needed short scale planning needs.
- timelines that need to be long but are never articulated or planned for are unlikely to usually spontaneously match the needed long scale planning needs.

-- not properly doing a needs and goals evaluation significantly raises the risk of goals being either incorrectly identified, or having goals indefinitely changing or rotating between amorphous unexamined but often entirely predictable areas.
4. Features_Goals: User-Features & Subfeatures/Under-The-Hood Features including design factors such as Categories of Types of Systems, Data-Types, Data-Structures, Structured Vs. Unstructured Data.(E.g. tech-stack and resources may be implicit for higher-level goals or explicit for resource-defined needs); lexicon: clarify jargon vs. description; 
- From a user-story standpoint, what is this project making? 
- From an Under-the-hood standpoint, what needs to be made and how for the project to be maintainable?
- Are these known? Do these need to be researched?
-- If you do not have a clear articulation of what you are doing (for a user/stakeholder to meet their clarified need) then it is unlikely that the possibly unknown goal will be accomplished in a maintainable way meeting the need of the user/stakeholder.
-- If you do not distinguish between and elucidate both user-story level features and sub-user-story level features (features/subfeatures) then quality, efficiency, and maintainability will be undermined.
5. MVP: 'MVP's (Minimum Viable Products); Deliverables Checklist;
Tools, 'Tool Stack / Tech Stack',
- Each MVP must not be an invocation of a reification-hallucination. 
- Iteratively proceeding with transparency and feedback to align and fine-tune is appropriate and time-tested in many projects.
- Articulating incremental MVP (minimum-viable-product) goals and stepping stones is an important part of progressing and communicating incrementally and/or progressing maintainably and sustainably. 
- Articulating incremental MVP (minimum-viable-product) goals and stepping stones is a skill in and of itself.
-- Without timely iterative MVP deliverables, feedback from the user about features and usability will be significantly hindered.
-- Without data and feedback about initial MVP outcomes, blindness will strangle the management of the project, coordination of people, and the management of resources.
6. Feedback_Learning: Learning, Tests, Communication, Signals, Documentation & Iteration, Organizational, System, and 'Ecological' Effects, (~Agile); Documenting-teaching-learning(skills); present skills, future skills (learning)
- Based on what signals will you define failure and orient to measure productivity?
- Whether formal or informal there must be effective ways of communicating what has been done within the project-team and between the project-team and the user/stakeholder.
- Long term maintainability involves communication (including with 'future you').
-- Failing to clearly map and communicate the differences between jargon terms and goal descriptions will result in mis-alignment between people and nonsense in planning.
-- The default patterns and processes of drift will misalign the team and user-stakeholders on many levels, making even detection of the misalignment a challenge.
-- Learning directly and indirectly related to the specific project is necessary. If you do not learn that a user/stakeholder's need is not being met then long term failure is highly probable. If you continually learn and develop useful skills then long term successes are more probable.

## Advocacy and support tools for 'process' 
#### Policy on Feedback, Errors, Mistakes, & Transparency: a process for reporting feedback (there needs to be a process and team-cultural permission to handle feedback and data): [2025.04.27]
- handling the predictable 'culture vs. data' conflicts:
-- rejecting [data, feedback, results, process, policy,] as being [disloyal, disrespectful, contrary to hierarchy-status, conspiracy, disobedience, etc.]
- Handing perception issues in goals choices
-- attractive reifications and abstractions (especially when undefinable)
- Definability of targets, goals, tasks, and solutions.
- An awareness of frequent but by default invisible areas of project mis-definition and mis-alignment and breakdown (project areas above)
#### moving from aspirational brainstorm definitions to implementable and maintainable definitions

##### Psychology of following through, dealing with discouragement
### Very Routine Problems:
- schedule-confusion: treating/describing early step as later steps (not uncommon)
- skipping steps: trying to jump to later steps without doing early-stage steps (not uncommon)
- indeterminate goals: constantly changing, appearing and disappearing, vague placeholders and proxies (not uncommon)
- no-plan: project description areas were, are, and likely will be empty; they need to be filled in. (not uncommon)
- lack of alignment around a Discovery & Identification Phase (not uncommon) ‘Where are you? -> Where are you going? -> How do you get there?’ You cannot skip the first part. 
## General Project State: (2025.01.27
- team project state (Agile, Kahneman Tversky, 6sigma)
- organizational project state (companies, libraries, schools, offices, labs)
- institutional administrative project state (municipal, regional) (crossing: public sector, private sector, academic (Hobbes, Locke)
- STEM project state (reproducible research)
- AI Project State (stateless or stateful architects)

### psychology, anthropology, of STEM and project management
- decisions
- project planning
- bias from illusions (not known to be illusions)
- cultivation of illusions
- sport addiction
- panic
- agile-churn
- fear of data and love of reifications
- 'blank stair' vacant-policy where there is zero identification of, recognition of, response or reaction to, or response to questions and feedback about clear (especially trivial or solvable) errors and problems (with or without their long term impacts). Blandly and blindly accumulating liabilities with no apparent consciousness of the trajectory of failure where such awareness is learn-able is a serious problem the correction of which is a high priority imperative. 
- STEM values, policy, and perception vs. unproductive default values and perceptions: the whole area of feedback, data, and ~agile alignment in projects relates to skills that must be learned and a default reaction that is dangerously unproductive: errors and feedback are by default repellant in a sport-ego-something-supersticious-ignorance modality of 'saving face' and potemkin village building. 'Policy' is a key concept area for learning and perceiving new areas of distinction that do not exist by default: long term matters, finding errors is not bad, feedback exists, feedback is an asset, alignment exists, alignment is an asset, solving-problems exists, solving-problems is an asset.

'''
The idea that you should not use process because you lack perfect eternal knowledge about a situation is strongly invalid. An analogy may be like saying "I won't ask the waiter for their recommendation if I don't know what's on the menu, because I don't know what's on the menu' is strategically incoherent: asking, communicating, and iterating is time tested "process" for both mostly known situations and especially for volatile and unknown situations. Another analogy might be saying, "We can't use a random-walk heuristic navigation process because we don't know where things are located, and/or locations might change beyond our control." This is strategically inverted and backwards: process is especially important when static knowledge about static conditions is absent, not the other way around. (2025/05)

# STEM Values
- "Can" 
- "Should"
- https://github.com/lineality/definition_behavior_studies
- Are long term maintainability, auditability, productivity, and survival, a lack of system-collapse,  'STEM values' or is STEM nihilistically 'value neutral' and absolutely disconnected from any aspect of values, ethics, morals, health, etc.?


# alignment with reality: General alignment with reality
- As known, participants will fantasize about fictional reifications.
## common perception problems and pitfalls
-  the 'sweet tooth' or 'channel surfing' problem, or 'eternal quest' problems
- people ignore details and endlessly search for a 'feels perfect' solution on entirely entertainment-stimulation criteria. 
- rebellion
- KT areas
- 
## STEM pathology psychology
- religious pathology
- sport pathology
## Common Bad Practices
- See: 2.2.5 Mismanaging Standard System Policy Areas
2.2.5 Mismanaging Standard System Policy Areas:
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
For example:  
1. Mismanaging Split substantiations: for example 
'they are all good' 
'they are all bad' 
'they should be dealt with by cramming them together or splitting them apart"
2. Golden circle asymmetry / inside outside asymmetry, deleterious effects include: 
- causality, 
- schedules,
- contracts.
3. System inversion (is a standard data artifact)
4. Basal distal disjunction (is a proxy(model) for (operationally defined system) 'violence')
5. Negative choices and definitions (do not ignore them)
6. Turning on and off (running) system processes ((for example) comparing policy from Roman Catholicism, South Korea, and Judaica)
7. Half-dark dichotomies (more on that later)

### needs, goals, and products
- topic: contracts and coordinated decisions
- contingency-logic-agreements: if else while break (cross-team?)
## Needs and Goals
- standard areas
## scope management and default bad expansion
## alignment management and default bad drift apart
## Decision Task Attributes:
- needs and goals array: past, present, expected future, goal future, ideal future
- schedule items
- 
## information infrastructure, protocols, and standards
## Weather analogy for agenda, policy, and long term vs. short term
- clarity of data
- perceptibility and definition of risk
- volatile cargo-cult sport causality-hallucination and proxies
- the problem of replacing policy and agenda with short term measurable goals
## Standard Fields: Goal Clarification and Disambiguation and/for Alignment
- Agenda Process Policy (e.g. Agile-KT-DefStud[software], SixSigma[specific utility repair], Steiner-Jung[brainstorm], Crime  Fraud & Corruption, etc.)
- User-Features, Subfeatures, and Tools[treasure map]("story?")
- Scope( Scope boundary examples or definitions?)
- Schedule[duration in days, started, target end]
## Best practice and bad practice
- loudest voices are not to be automatically followed
- simplistic proxies for decisions such as arbitrary numbers of requests
- skipping a decision step and letting scope go directly see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQnz7L6x068
## Decision and Automation
- balancing and checking where 'automated' work is going?
- checking for bad proxies, abdications, and reifications
- functional-definition area?
## Negative Definitions in Systems-Management, Project-Management, Organization-Management Product management, etc.
There are a lot of tradeoffs with no automatic or easily findable balance, and there are affirmative goals that are not trivial to set, but there is also the low hanging fruit of negative definitions that are easier to identify // 2025.01.23)
###What are not goals:
- hiding things for the sake of hiding things is not a goal
- creating stacks of abstractions for the sake of creating stacks of abstractions is not a goal
- disinformation is not a goal
- short-term over long-term is not a goal
- solution-proxies: meaningless abstraction cargo-cult delusions are not a goal
- extreme mis-alignment is not a goal
- not learning, not skill improving, not training is not a goal
### oositive goals, ish:
- data/information hygiene is a goal

## Bad Wrong Assumptions about Mind 
Stop these assumptions: 
- everyone is automatically aligned (on scope, goals decisions)
- everyone has automatic perfect time-traveling knowledge from and about everyone else
- everyone know what is going on and what to do
- everyone has impossible tools to solve impossible problems
- everyone instantly learns and generalizes everything with time-travel
- no one makes schedule mistakes
- communication is automatic and effortless and uses time travel

## Modeling a persistent failure to learn
- 
- cases: 'reappraisals' --TJ

## Collapse & Negative Definitions
- mirages caused by collapse: 'bad planning' and the illusion of pejorative reifications
- 'takeover' vs. 'vacuum', 'taken over by a vacuum'?

## Mapping Bad Equilibria in Mindspace
- KT kahneman and tversky areas
- agile areas
- areas known since greece
- survival of mind issues

# Survival of Mind
- 'panic mode' mid-sprint in agile
- overly blocking any management of a basic project area

# Panic as a definable project space disfunction

### Aspects of general junkfood behavior:
(2025.01.16)
1. choices made in strongly private situations (maybe not the same an anonymous environments)
2. peer pressure and trolling bullying hazing disinformation torture against health food and healthy habits.

Both are different, and both are often ignored/denied areas. 
And both may involve the bazaar cargo-cult of undefined 'rational behavior' which emerged or became dominant in the postwar period.

# The General Problem Space of Project Decisions:
- Decision making skills especially in a context of projects are a critical part of education and fall naturally into general-STEM education.
- It is possible that planning STEM-Education is itself a classic example of the presence of significant definable deficits in decision-making skills and abilities, especially including coordinated-decisions and project outcomes. 
Biases:
- aesthetic bias
- momentum/tradition bias
- disinformation bias
- indeterminacy bias
- spite & perversity bias
- churn bias

General Participation & The Health of Systems
2024.01.06
The shift from a simple set of goals into a set of goals much more affirmatively focused on protecting participation, communication, and coordination among diverse participants in a society. 

This set goal could be stated as: Use STEM based methods and policies to help defend against disruption and collapse of communication and coordinated decisions in and across diverse groups and perspectives in project-complating societies with general participation of members.

## short term and long term decision making
- "dark patterns" and short term vs. long term decisions
https://www.economist.com/business/2025/10/16/why-bosses-need-to-wake-up-to-dark-patterns
- "to eschew dark patterns is that they can hurt their firms’ long-term interests. Consumers dislike egregious attempts to manipulate them into buying things: the study by Messrs Luguri and Strahilevitz found that aggressive techniques upset the consumers"
- "patterns can replicate without much thought. According to Marie Potel, a co-founder of Fair Patterns, a firm that helps to fix dark patterns, problematic designs are often cut and pasted from standard templates."
### Detection of short term and long term problems
- short cycle bubbles (fewer than 5 years)
- indefinite embedded long term problems

## Data and Illusions:
coordination decision systems need to set up in such a way that data and a tether to reality are able to keep in check and prevail over the tendency towards illusions and coverups and in potemkin villages.
Literally or proverbially software since 1970 has been a self-conspiracy among complacent developers who prioritize their won recreation and entertainment experience over reality and the effects of the software they create to result in a space-trash 'polluted' environment of hidden problems where the priority is lipstick-on-a-pig fads and pedantic distractions. Developers spend huge amounts of time entertaining themselves with the 'self-care' of beautifying their keyboard and beautifying their desk and beautifying their background and beautifying editor/IDE and beautifying their 'self commenting' code, and creating the fun-illusion of their own personal entertainment pleasure seeking experience, complete with the fun of being a bullying manager, the fun of randomizing other people's schedules, blaming interns for the problems of senior staff etc, enjoyably, defiantly defying basic Agile project management areas and being a coder cowboy bro rockstar. The result is very predictably ruin and toxification, which is predictably (potemkin village) hidden away and covered up with more lipstick and distraction beautification, blaming down hill, wasting more time on entertainment junkfood and 'self-care.' By analogy, coordinated decisions and elections may be able to work well or fail to work well around similar criteria.

## Open, Closed, and SOS, Coordination:
(From Project Uma)
# Open Node, S.O.S. Team-Channel
One of the founding inspirations in the history of the developing of UMA, where many different situations from Prof. Skip Ellis' Project Neem to project management, to education, to secure voting protocols, was that I was living in Japan during the 3.11 Daishinsai Tsunami, Quake, Nuclear-Meltdown, electrical grid failure, cell/mobile phone system failure, etc. Though I was not in a hard hit area at the time, when I traveled to volunteer and work in the North Coastal region I saw and spoke with ordinary people about the tangible need to have some kind of robust signal sending system, some kind of distributed ad-hoc network for large or small emergency situations.

There are a few main things that UMA needs to be or have for an SOS team-channel to work in a way that could have helped in the Daishinsai or in other or lesser situations.

1. finely constrained and load-managed signals:
For better or worse, the history of signal sending from (if proverbial) Byzantine General problems, to early Gutenberg incunabula, to the management of codes and signals during WWI that came from and fed back into computer science: computer science is not based on and does not confirm the naive ideology that 'computer everything in every way and print everything in every way forever' is a feasible way get anything done; disregard for details is completely contrary to computer science. There are a large but manageable number of feasibility constraints that a solution must satisfy in order to be a practical project and product plan: using more resources than exist won't work. 

Security and data hygiene are also important factors on many levels: Sending data types or quantities of data that break the system won't work. 

Deliberate abuse is (again, look at history) a prominent consideration that cannot be claimed to be a surprise. 

The Open-SOS team-channel/mode is not designed to be a vaguely open network where anyone or everyone can send anything or everything in any way or every way to anyone or everyone anywhere or everywhere at any time or at all times. 

The Open-SOS team-channel/mode will be as narrowly an strictly and minimally defined so as to be robust and practical within the scope of what is needed. 
For example:
reserved specified listening port: 44444
enum: u8 byte array for latitude 
enum: u8 byte array for longitude
enum: u16 int pre-specified situation code, borrowed from first responders

At a super-minimal SOS signal system, these three size and type constrained byte and int fields may be all that is needed to send and receive a help-signal in a robust way across platforms that minimizes the risk of 'sending a malicious signal'

Another part of this is making sure that the receiving side, however imperfectly, has a minimal scope as well, e.g.
- listen at 44444
- if you get flooded with signals, e.g. if more than 8 signals in 10 sec, pause listening for 10-min (or some number). 
- store only a reasonably small number of signals (which depends on how small the signals are), perhaps in the range of 8-512 signals (with 8 being a lite default)
- be able to externalize these signals to pass them on to an emergency service.

Even though at some times and places deranged people will spam fake emergency signals just to be destructive (with no benefit to anyone), the overall system can likely be designed so that this is an acceptable amount of noise just in case the system really is needed. e.g. 8 small spam signals every 10 minutes that you can just ignore is not going to over-tax your system.

This is not without risk but likely has minimal risk. You cannot use this to send an open-ended message, e.g. something a young student should not see. The worst may be if someone is lured to a bandit trap location from a fake signal. This may or may not be a significant risk depending on the details. There is no requirement to have such an S.O.S. channel if it is a liability. 

A more useful but also more risky option is to allow a person to share connection information as fields in the signal. There are emergency situations where this would be an asset, but general default-malicious behavior demonstrates that most of the time this would be used by predators to attempt attacks on people who were lured into creating a connection with the attacker. There may be reasonable balances where for example completely vulnerable young children would not be able to set up and configure this feature on their own (or build their own software and hardware from scratch to do the same thing), but emergency-tech-teams would have the option to send and receive connection information as an option. 

See the next section for another significant part of the puzzle.


2. Multi-Band Signal Use: 
Uma is designed deliberately to only have connection, configuration information exchanged and set up out-of-band manually by the user: connections cannot be added or removed maliciously or deliberately by a remote-collaborator. Only a local user can, out of band (not as part of an online connection) add or remove team-channel and address-book configuration files; these files are not in the shared synced project-graph-nodes data.

Also, in version 1 Uma only uses internet IP signals and addresses: if you do not know someone's IP (and all the other team-channel configuration information) you cannot send them any information. 

In this context, where SOS is a (theoretical) 'minimal-open-channel' you would still need to know someone's IP address to send them an S.O.S. signal: this alone likely make the whole idea of an open-channel entirely useless and bazaar: you can listen for S.O.S. signals, but no one can send them to you (unless they are already a team-collaborator and so don't need to). 

This is where signal-band comes in:
If Uma is able to use a standard, local, CB-radio band spectrum to send and receive signals, then Uma can listen on, e.g. channel 4, sub-channel 4, for anyone near you broadcasting an emergency signal. 

## White-Knite signal-Relay:
(pending, maybe out of scope)


3. Portable, solar powered devices

Could mobile-devices/smart-phones be equipped to do something like this but even better? I do not see why not in principle, and will look into exploring this as phone software, but for whatever reasons using phones for distributed signal networks is not what phone hardware OS and software makers are doing or intend to do. People love the single point of failure of centralized signal towers, and people have tunnel vision for what they love.

Notes:
The question of whether UMA needs either an ad-hoc connection system, and s.o.s. system, a signal-relay system, etc., is debatable. If you assume that everyone doing a project everywhere in the universe has an reliable ipv6 address, then no UMA does not need anything else, and in 2024 most users of UMA will likely be normal ipv4-ipv6 internet users. But it is not entirely unlikely that researchers in locations without internet (or without reliable internet) or people/towns in locations with reliable internet, or deep-web groups not operating on the clear web internet (which is ~96% of the internet itself) may want to or need to use some local-intranet which does not use ipv4-ipv6 but uses some other signal 'band.'

There is also the past and future question:
1. Could Uma have been made and used in the 1960's (or even the 1940's perhaps, or if a stretch the 1840's)? Yes, in some form. Was there ipv4-ipv6 back then? No, so Uma would have used (like the Telegraph and AM-Radio) something else.

2. Will people in the future, for example teams on Mars, be using 2024-style ipv4-ipv6 to communicate? While an earth-internet will eventually be set up on mars, it is either unlikely that all networks and signals on mars will use the earth-internet IP system or that they will use only the earth-ip system.

A related question is: when satellites and cube-sats around mars communicate: do they use ipv6? It is possible that something technically does, but in general, no satellites do not use the internet to communicate with each-other. 

Uma can and should be a portable, minimal, platform-agnostic, protocol and system for managing project and collaboration. 

Are there use-cases for a robust distributed graph-database that is not reliant on ip-connections: absolutely.

from Japan’s influence in Central Asia
Kishida Fumio, Japan’s prime minister, was supposed to travel from Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan for a four-day summit this weekend. The trip was canceled at the last minute because of warnings of a giant earthquake striking Japan’s Pacific coast. But Mr Kishida is eager to attend virtually.

Central Asia—home to vast amounts of untapped natural gas and oil, and copper and uranium—has long fallen under the sway of Russia and China. But Japan, a staunch ally of America, wants to strengthen its influence there. Ahead of the summit Japanese officials agreed to put out a statement with five Central Asian countries about the importance of “rule of law”—an indirect criticism of how the region’s two big autocracies are challenging order and stability.

Loosening Russia and China’s grip on the region in any meaningful way would be difficult. But the prospective summit has already upset Russia’s officials. They accused Japan of attempting to “penetrate” the region with “Western ideology”.

## Short term project state, long term project state and object permanence
- while some hominids have some object-permanence perception for some overt physical objects, when it comes to long term project state and causality the games of adults are frighteningly similar to games of children. institutional decisions are made based on crude peek-a-boo brain stimulation either with no evidence of awareness of repeating long term patterns, or with evidence of a deliberate potemkin village to hide the permanent reality in order to cultivate a self-stimulation addiction. Every short term excuse becomes a grotesque generalization of a uniform past-present-future that endlessly changes state (in an amnesiac way where participants apparently have no memory or awareness of this constant change). 
A 'sport' example of this may be in international high level chess where the match commentary declares that whatever ephemeral prediction is made now is universally true for all past and future time, changing constantly in a disturbingly amnesiac way. (This may also be a kind of disease of hyperbolic-dialectical-journalism.)
An institutional example of this borrowed from Daniel Khaneman may be where any short term of no-term abstract success indicator is used to declare an administrator 'always strong and victorious' or 'forever a weak loser' based on completely random noise that changes minute to minute.

##  STEM, Context, and Measurement vs. Nihilism, Disinformation & Collapse

## Process & the Hypothetico-Deductive Method
2025.05.28
There is perhaps a strange parallel in negative-definition where future-state in short-term vs. long term is only negatively defined. Dealing with continued-failure-to-disprove quantitatively with the tools of STEM may be similar to modeling non-collapse. 'Process vs. Outcome' seem superficially to differ, as we think of outcomes being measured. But the negatively defined state of a time-series of measurements not-heading in a bad direction is perhaps compatible with a STEM approach to process.

### Voting Logistics and Ethics: Western Chasm
The odd paradox of people in the west believing that voting is inherently good, yet still with the old dark-age-curse never recovered from that views anything 'worldly' as being an evil monster to be destroyed, with the absurd compromise of being willing to live: "in the world but not of it" or some rubbish. Pay attention to what you are doing and do things properly so no one gets hurt, for heaven's sake that is not an evil plot for destruction; it is a definition of responsibility and at least attempting to do what one ought to do.

In any given human endeavor where there appears to be some relative success and competition at a given time, it can be non-trivial to identify what the future trajectory is for those who appear 'correct' at one given time, and to ascribe 'success' to what may be either a random outcome or an incomplete act of self-destruction.

# information epidemiology and demand distortion
(2025 11 08)
- everything has a default of system collapse within context
- everything is susceptible to contagious/spreading system-definition patterns and disturbance regime dynamics
- information asymmetry can refer either to demand distortion exploited by demand (for mutual long term loss) or exploited by supply (for mutual long term loss)
- non-automatic-skills, literacy, patience, and best practice including learning are (non-automatic) infrastructure needed for survival and non-collapse
- radicalization, extremism, demand-distortion, and 'rip-off economy' 'bad actors'(terminology from The Economist)

## standard definition problems
- pseudo-dialectical definitions (The Stalin Method)
-- say multiple self contradictory things, then case by case claim you are always right and to be rewarded and everyone else is to be punished (sometimes with maximum cruelty for recreation).

## Converting and Interfacing Structured and Unstructured Data
- The world is not made of structured information.
- Interfacing in both directions from raw unstructured information
to structured and semi-structured information,
is a set of processes.
- Sometimes structured information is very useful and functional (STEM).
- Sometimes structured information abstractions are a recreational luxury for whim.

## Empty placeholders in process reification illusions and goal reification illusions
- empty placeholder abstractions are not project goals or project processes for achieving goals
- adding more empty placeholder abstractions does not fill existing empty placeholder abstractions

- people wanting to 'run for' election again indefinately
- groups and teams not cultivating a next generation (future future)
Administrations failing to support their own successors:
- Clinton Administration not supporting A. Gore in 2000, who lost so narrowly that he may have won (winning popular vote).
- Obama Administration not supporting H. Clinton in 2016, who lost narrowly (winning popular vote). 
- Biden Administration in 2024 apparently having no successor to run at all.
- limiting the time and scope of 'emergency powers' which historically are needed in real emergencies, and are also historically frivolously invoked by anyone who wants a power grab at any time for no reason.
Q: In what specific ways is succession a strongly persistent point constant repeating failure, with only slow and fragile development of methods and technologies for the problem?
Q: How have the concerns of historical thinkers from Hobbes to Montesque to John Adams (and many others) A. held up as ways of articulating the problems, and B. been addressed by later developments?

# Search, Structuring, & State: The unsolved problem of search:

Clear Description Matter

From 'search' to 'chat' and back again.

Does "AI" = 'Better Search"?

In retrospect the 2023 'ai revolution' may be seen and described as a 'search done better and possible locally' breakthrough, which largely came out of google (search giant) technology (transformers) and operates like the google search page, except the search button now says 'chat.' 

Calling search 'chat' may be an example of introduction a needless and meaningless layer of abstraction that causes personal and social confusion.

It is possible that is 'chatGPT' were called 'searchGPT' and called 'search' not 'AI', and 'gen-ai' being 'generative-search' not 'gen-ai' that the same technology and adoption may be processed without all of the misplaced 'super ai taking over the world'.

For example retrieval-augmented-search (or retrieval augmented generative search) is not a bad description for 'retrieval augmented generation' which confusingly ignores the entire non-generative vector-search part of the workflow.  

If we take a step back from the fiction that people are 'chatting' with a stateful full-intelligence, rather that doing stateless 'searches' with very wonderful search, smart search, vector search, generative search, technologies, things make much more sense, are much more clear, and avoid all the undefined nonsense around undefinable terms and the fantasies they invoke in people. 

A few issues are key here in the search context:
1. 'generalization'
2. 'explainability'
3. externalization
4. state and project-state
5. unstructured-to-structured conversions
6. tech stack
7. matrix-processing

STEM Health-check analysis:

### Quote
"At home he began to read the Social Democratic press, examine the speeches of its leaders, study its organization, reflect on its psychology and political techniques and ponder the results. He came to three conclusions which explained to him the success of the Social Democrats: They knew how to create a mass movement, without which any political party was useless; they had learned the art of propaganda among the masses; and, finally, they knew the value of using what he calls “spiritual and physical terror.” This third lesson, though it was surely based on faulty observation and compounded of his own immense prejudices, intrigued the young Hitler. Within ten years he would put it to good use for his own ends. I understood the infamous spiritual terror which this movement exerts, particularly on the bourgeoisie, which is neither morally nor mentally equal to such attacks; at a given sign it unleashes a veritable barrage of lies and slanders against whatever adversary seems most dangerous, until the nerves of the attacked persons break down… This is a tactic based on precise calculation of all human weaknesses, and its result will lead to success with almost mathematical certainty… I achieved an equal understanding of the importance of physical terror toward the individual and the masses… For while in the ranks of their supporters the victory achieved seems a triumph of the justice of their own cause, the defeated adversary in most cases despairs of the success of any further resistance.49 No more precise analysis of Nazi tactics, as Hitler was eventually to develop them, was ever written."
from Page ~45 - "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" by William L. Shirer

To what extent is it possible using symbolic or subsymbolic modeling to detect the presence and prevalence of 'terror' as used by Shirer? 
Are similar corrupt and fraudulent practices not used by 'fire and brimstone' so-called-self-identified-"religious" groups, by 'doom-and-gloom' so-called-self-identified-'environmental' groups, by learned-helplessness inducing so-called-self-identified-'education' institutions and "professionals"?

## roles votes and definitions:
One person physically able to vote gets one vote is a very blunt way of deciding who should be voting on a topic, with assumptions that make (made) more sense in low-tech local elections where only local people within an age-range could physically vote. But with various technologies from transportation and translation to networks, that rough match becomes less clear.
There are a lot of factors and edge cases, with a possibly related topic of district-creation and gerrymandering which run up against challenges where the main problem may be people's refusal to confront the issues. 
'Make the design-choice go away." is not a good plan.

# Definitions in Projects and STEM (version 2025 05 30)


# Contents / Areas:
1. Categories of Types of Systems and Linearity:
2. Data-Types & Type-Strict/Type-Safe Code:
3. ~Data-Structures:
4. "Structured" vs. "Unstructured" Data:

There are a few levels of organization and clarification that are important for clearly defining the scope and goals of projects, for example so that you know in sufficient detail what you are dealing with, what you are doing, what processes are involved, and what tools you can use.

As with STEM itself there is often, sadly, so far no clear shared vocabulary for these topics, but the topics are very real empirically and whatever they are called you will face them doing projects.

For example, any policy or feature defining or described with the term/topic 'model explainability' should be clearly described in the areas outlined here.


# 1. Categories of Types of Systems and Linearity:
1. null-core
2. jump-gap [null-core]
3. one tree
4. near off the one tree
5. jump-gap [off-the-one-tree]
6. (far) off the one tree

Note: The role of 'statistics' in tethering the one-tree to the null-core.

A key issue in miscommunication and misunderstandings around STEM is the assumption that there is a single kind of 'STEM-stuff,' which might by analogy be similar to a beginner programmer having trouble because they don't believe in 'data-types' or 'data-structures' thinking that all code is one uniform type of 'Code-stuff.' There is no single type of 'code-stuff' (though Python goes a good job of bridging types for non-production code) and there is no single type of 'STEM-stuff.'

1. The null-core is the purely conceptual, tautological ('by-definition') area. Pure math and logic are here.

3. The one-tree is an interlocking STEM aggregate structure of empirical and measurable world-phenomena that are sufficiently close to (especially simple and linear) null-core principles. It is a kind of functional-map that is one big interlocking tree of inter-operable definitions that sufficiently describes those patterns that are stable enough to be mapped. That this area is generally unified may give rise to the misunderstanding that all of STEM is one homogenous thing.

2. There is an important gap between the null-core of concepts (which is rules floating in rule-space) and the one-tree of sufficient simple models pragmatically pasted over real-world empirical phenomena. This is a kind of cluster of blindspots and neglected definitions for most people but is absolutely crucial when doing projects. This is one area where the rubber meets the road, where conceptual models do or don't describe and help navigate reality. 'Statistics' is one of the arm-wavy dismissive terms used to wave-away this area, and 'statistics' is yet another punt: Is statistics math? logic? probability? empirical? conceptual? Doing projects you will need to navigate this jump-gap, and the tools needed such as statistics, and the definition problems (is what you need 'statistics' and what exactly does 'statistics' mean, or otherwise what exactly do you need even if there is no word or it?) and the social-cultural-psychological challenges which are a massive set-of-areas, for example the life's works of Daniel Kahneman and Amous Tversky are (if more that you can absorb in a lifetime) one of many pieces of this frontier quagmire).  

4. Near-Off-The-One-Tree:
The one-tree is often best defined as a simple linear relationship, but as systems get nonlinear, dynamical, and even "chaotic." As empirical phenomena and models get less-linear, the coherence and utility of the one-tree (in short) breaks down. Near-off the one tree can be, and needs to be, described as an asset to the one-tree. 

6. (Far)-Off-The-Nne-Tree is real and empirical but often not able to be modeled and connected to the one tree. This is a frontier in many respects.

5. jump-gap [off-the-one-tree]
One way (if provisional) of describing this area is that slightly non-linear behavior can still be effectively be connected to the one tree, such as mostly being described as linear (case by case the details of this likely vary a lot). But once phenomena are highly nonlinear (or highly whatever-problem) they cannot be cleanly connected to the one-tree and there is another jump-gap (or more likely a cluster of myriad types-of-jumpgaps for the many different ways something may not fit on the one tree). While the null-core-jump-gap is somewhat 'solved' and somewhat understood, this next jump-gap is something STEM professionals have struggled to articulate and describe from the late 1800's through the 1900's and beyond to time of writing in 2025.


# 2. Data-Types & Type-Strict/Type-Safe Code:
Whether or not you are dealing with code directly in your project

Depending on your project, you may or may not be able to effectively lump-together data-types. For example, a non-production Python project requires less type-strictness, a production Rust project requires more type-strictness. Strictness is not always important in and of itself, but it can be essential depending on the details of a project. Neglecting this (in either direction) can result in total failure in a state of confusion and misunderstanding, which is bad.


# 3. ~Data-Structures:
- ~dict
- json
- hash-table
- ~table

Similar to data-types, data-structures vary across language and environment and across disciplines/professions. As with data-types, sometimes you need to be strict (sometimes you need to be flexible) depending on the details of the project. 


# 4. Structured vs. Unstructured Data:
- tabular-data
- dictionary/hash-table data
- ~"semi-structured"

This is a crucial area in many projects but it has perhaps the worse lexicon and miscommunication and insufficient definitions are significant risks here.

'Structured' data is roughly tabular or 'dictionary' data, but 'dictionary' is defined differently across and within various programming languages with no single overall lexicon.

'Semi-structured' language is confusingly used to refer to either dictionaries (as opposed to tables with rows and columns, even if the data-defined is identical) or to hybrid data such as json-dictionary that contains unstructured natural language.

You will need to clearly describe your project manually, not being able to use a lexicon that does not exist.



Note:
Undefined terms (one might say 'undefined behaviors') such as the term 'complexity' and 'complex' are often lethally toxic in project management. These terms defy definition and are weapons of system-collapse whether wielded by incompetence, malice, or perhaps more often 'indeterminate incompetence and malice' (which is not even recognized by most people as the real threat and actor that it is). If you encounter such a term, require that it is clearly defined or prohibit its use in planning. "I don't know what I want and I don't know what I'm doing and I don't know what I'm talking about." is not a project plan, outline, or proposal regardless of how much lipstick is used to rephrase it.

Note: This book unfortunately sometimes uses the term 'process' interchangeably for compulsive-reification-distraction and imaginary rule-procedures about rule-procedures that are not anchored in reality: the is unfortunate and might be confusing to or misleading for people who are not familiar with the Agile or Kahneman-Tversky (or ecology) use of the term 'process' for navigating pragmatically and productively using feedback through distractions and unknowns to focus on measurable outcomes and system productivity. "Process" and "best practice" are important tools in the toolbox for productivity avoiding psychological/perceptual traps. 
Then in chapter 3-4, the author refers to 'process' with a completely different and positive meaning, ~'process-knowledge' (a topic the economist remarked on regarding NASA loosing know-how after the 'moon-shot' self sabotaging of long term space plans). This focus on maintainability of technology, with the exellent analogy of the Ise-JIngu, is something that should be more discussed. But we should not overload the term 'process' in ways bound to cause confusion: naming things is hard. Do not give one thing two names; do not give two things one name.


Lexicon issues aside... so far(still reading) this book is fabulous for cutting through and pointing out the de jure pathological 'anti-productivity' 'anti-maker' 'anti-engineering' 'anti-STEM' 'anti-data' wave of destructive extremist ideology that has been suffocating the USA. It is refreshing to hear a clear voice describing the disfunctional, culturally and psychological toxic, illiterate world I have been unendingly attacked by and have unsuccessfully tried to defend productivity against my entire life, briefly finding glimpses of sanity living abroad in Japan.
All ~countries/nations/republics including the USA can and should achieve sanity and the ability to navigate: can and should. Just as families, communities, schools and institutions can and do teach and require hand-washing and biological epidemiology safeguards, so we can and should do the same for psychological/perceptual/linguistic hygiene. History is full of the 'disturbance regimes' of popular extremism that destroys geographies just like fires or diseases, yet this seems to be persistently invisible. We need to learn to be aware of this persistent problem.

from https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/01/22/what-an-arcane-piece-of-aviation-law-says-about-britains-government 
"The slots regime is a mid-century relic. In Britain—as around the world—rights are grandfathered: as long as an airline uses a slot 80% of the time, it can hold onto it, free, in perpetuity. That was fine in the 1960s when runway space was abundant; now that such space is heavily congested, it produces a clogged-up market. At Heathrow, 99% of slots are grandfathered: spare ones come up for sale rarely and at a stonking price. Challengers are locked out, or stay small. Inefficiency is rewarded: it is better for an airline to send up small or empty planes than forfeit a slot to a rival."

How not to lose your head
Bartleby’s (May 31st) three principles when managers face a crisis of plan, decentralise and prioritise were firmly embedded a quarter of a century ago in the work of Karl Weick and Kathleen Sutcliffe, which emerged from their empirical research on a multitude of organisations, including defence forces, hospitals and first responders.

They listed five principles (which some have expanded to seven): 
1. expect failure; 
2. be sensitive to what is happening—someone is paying attention—and do not wait for directions from headquarters; 
3. do not simplify and take nothing for granted; 
4. organise to expect challenge and change—help others and expect to be helped by others; and 
5. maintain a deference to expertise.

These principles constantly stand the test of time, if only in retrospect, when failing organisations discover them afresh.
